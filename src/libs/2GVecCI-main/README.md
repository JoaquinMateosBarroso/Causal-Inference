# 2GVecCI
 Code for the article 'Vector Causal Inference between two Groups of Variables' published at AAAI 2023. Arxiv version: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14283

To run simulated data experiments run execute_experiment_2GVecCI.py
Different choices of parameter configurations used in the paper are available in the folder Parameters.

To run a real data example on Surface Air Temperature Data, run real_data.py. We use NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 data that was provided by NOAA PSL, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their website at https://psl.noaa.gov. It is included in the file AirTempData.nc

All functions used in the experiments including the main methods developed in the article are gathered in the function compendium Functions_2GVecCI.py
